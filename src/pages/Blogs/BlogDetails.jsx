                  <h4>BNDR</h4>
                  <p>
                    I worked on the countryâ€™s largest diabetes management web
                    application, a PHP-based platform serving over 650,000
                    patients nationwide. The system records and reports patient
                    statistics across all diabetes centers in the country. This
                    is a huge web application with a lot of functionalities in
                    it
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    Following the departure of the senior developer, I assumed
                    responsibility for these projects like BNDR, DLP, CCVD etc. My key contributions
                    included:
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    Developing and maintaining new features on the live PHP
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    Managing the SQL database to ensure accuracy, scalability,
                    and reliability.
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    Handling deployments and version control through Unfuddle.
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    Administering and troubleshooting on Linux servers to keep
                    the application stable and accessible.
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    This project demanded strong technical ownership and
                    problem-solving, as it was a mission-critical healthcare
                    solution used nationwide.

                  <p>
                    I contributed to the maintenance and some development of an online examination platform (DLP), a large-scale PHP-based web application serving over 150,000 medical students nationwide. The platform provides a wide range of functionalities, including:
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    Distribution of educational resources such as PDFs and study materials.
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    Personalized student dashboards for tracking progress and activities.
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    A secure live examination system with integrated video monitoring for proctoring. Especially PCA and ECE examination
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    This project was a comprehensive solution designed to support digital learning and ensure the integrity of online assessments at scale.

                    As its scope and functionality closely resembled the DLP system, I have not repeated the same details here.
